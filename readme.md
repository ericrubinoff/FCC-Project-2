### FCC Project 2 | Survey Form

Check out the final result [here](https://ericrubinoff.github.io/FCC-Project-2/).

##### Introduction

Very excited to show off my second FreeCodeCamp project, this time a simple survey form which I decided to spice-up with a modern black theme.

##### Challenge

On this second project I felt more confortable with writing the HTML and CSS, so the biggest challenge came from obsessing with the layout and dark theme. 

I'm really proud with how it came out for being my first form and I'm looking forward to applying this same techniques on a future project.
